This file will provide you with a brief description of FreeSMS and instructions
on how to install FreeSMS.

Since it's development in 2003, FreeSMS has successfully offered educational organizations
an easy to use and effective facility to manage courses, teachers and students.
FreeSMS provides the following features:

 - Support for profile based management: Administrator, Teacher and Student
 - Online teacher and student registration

 - Allow admin to add students and enroll them to one or more courses
 - Allow admin to edit students already entered into database
 - Allow admin to edit courses already entered into database

 - Allow teachers to display graphically course attendance and feedback
 - Allow students to check their enrollment and provide feedback for a course
 
Features to implement:

 - Allow admin to perform sanity checks on the database
 - Allow students/admin to withdraw from an enrolled course

From a technical perspective FreeSMS is based on PHP5 and requires a MySQL database. This 
demonstration site has been tested on: 

openSUSE 11.4 with
 - Apache 2.2.17 (<a href="http://www.apache.org">www.apache.org</a>)
 - PHP 5.3.6 (<a href="http://www.php.net">www.php.net</a>)
 - MySQL 5.5.13 (<a href="http://www.mysql.com">www.mysql.com</a>)
 
 and
 
 Windows Seven 32 bits with
 - WampServer 2.1 (<a href="http://www.wampserver.com/">www.wampserver.net</a>) or
 - XAMPP 1.7.4 (<a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html</a>)

In order to install FreeSMS, please use the following instructions:

1. Download FreeSMS: 
====================
FreeSMS can be downloaded at http://sourceforge.net/projects/freesms/.
You need also a properly configured http server (e.g. Apache) capable
of running php code and a MySQL server. On Windows OSs the recommended
approach is to use WampServer or XAMPP.

2. Extract FreeSMS: 
===================
Now that you have a zip file, you need to extract it a directory in the 
path of your web server root (or have an alias setup). For example, if 
you have a public_home folder you could extract there FreeSMS archive. 

3. MySQL Server Database Setup:
===============================
For security reasons, you need a 'root' account with nonempty password configured on the MySQL server.
Also, for the same reasons, the password of the user account needed to access the FreeSMS database cannot be empty.
From web browser: go to the following link: http://<server>/freesms/mysql/setup.php
and follow the instructions (root access to the MySQL database is needed).
From Linux terminal: use the bash script provided in "[Install Directory]/mysql/" folder 
(root access to the MySQL database is needed).

4. Configure PHP Script:
========================
We now need to setup the primary configuration file that FreeSMS
requires to successfully administer the application. In the directory
"[Install Directory]/classes/" you fill find a file crc_constants.mod.php. 
Open this file and modify MYSQL_SERVER, MYSQL_PORT, MYSQL_DB, MYSQL_USER and MYSQL_PASS
constants to reflect the connection parameters that need to be used when FreeSMS 
interacts with the MySQL database.

Once the file has been modified approprietly, you can now use one of the links
below to login into FreeSMS, enjoy!


5. Start Using FreeSMS:
